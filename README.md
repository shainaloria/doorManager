Application built using processing that can lock or unlock the door. 

Door bell sometimes disturbs the whole household even though the visitor only needs to be catered by one person.
Most of the time, we wish we could see the visitor first before we get up and go to the door every single time. 

This application that aims to help the owner of the house control the door. 
When a visitor pushes the button that acts as "silent door bell", a notification should appear on the homeowner's phone
and this would allow the owner view who is in front of his or her door. 
The application could also check the status of the door and lock (or unlock) the door remotely.

Materials used:
Arduino Uno
LED shield/button
servo motor (SG90)
